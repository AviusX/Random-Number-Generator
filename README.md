# Random-Number-Generator
A simple program to generate random numbers. Takes both date and time as seed for higher unpredictability.

Takes min and max as input for range for the generation of the random number and outputs a random number in that range.

The point of this project was not to make the best random number generator, but to understand how the same code can be used to achieve different, preferably somewhat unpredictable outputs every time it is run.
